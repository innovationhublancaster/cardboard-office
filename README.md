# Cardboard Office

View the Innovation Hub's office in VR with Google Cardboard. Created for the UCISA SS15 conference presentation.

This was created by hacking together by building a photshphere viewer in three.js with stereo view for VR using code from Google's VR expeiments to make it cardboard friendly.
